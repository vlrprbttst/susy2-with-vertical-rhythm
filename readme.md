BoxTent is a frontend workflow that gives you the infrastructure to build your next website prescribing web development best practices to deliver a state of the art product to your users. With the help of Grunt and Bower, BoxTent automates your workflow and takes care of assets optimization, concatenation, minification and much more. BoxTent includes out of the box support for:

* Sass (`.scss`) compilation with Compass support

All you need to do is download or fork the repository from github and install the necessary dependencies to start coding right away. You are the one in control of the technology, the plugins and the frameworks you want to use for your project.
